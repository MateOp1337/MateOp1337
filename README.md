## Hi!

I’m MateOp (or MetoOp, sometimes jokingly "Mysz"). My real name is Mateusz, and I’m from Poland (Polska górą!).

I’m a beginner full-stack developer coding mainly in Python, HTML, and JS (including Node.js). Right now, I’m focused on my biggest project, **Imperator** – a bot for my server *Imperium* ("Empire"). I’m also working on **XMLCord** and have plans to release **DataStore**, a tool for secure, encrypted data storage using PBKDF2HMAC.

I’m diving into **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, **React**, and databases to improve my skills. I like using **JSON5** and **YML** in my newer projects (though JSON still sneaks in sometimes). I care most about security, stability, and clean, readable code – always aiming to stick to PEP8.

## Support me

If you'd like to support me in developing my main project (**Imperium**) and help me achieve one of my dreams – building a large, active Discord community – feel free to join my server: [Imperium Discord](https://discord.gg/7DFXSvcETu).
