## Hi!  

I’m MateOp (or MetoOp, sometimes jokingly "Mysz"). I’m from Poland (*Polska gurom!*).  

I’m a beginner full-stack developer (coding mainly in Python, HTML, and JS (including Node.js). Right now, I’m focused on my biggest projects: **Stormy** and **Imperator**. **Stormy** is an all-in-one Discord bot, while **Imperator** is a bot tailored for my Discord guild, *Imperium* (*"Empire"*). I’m also working on **XMLCord** and have plans to release **DataStore**, a tool for secure and encrypted data storage using PBKDF2HMAC.  

I’m diving into **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, **React**, and databases to enhance my skills. I prefer using **JSON5** and **YML** in newer projects, though JSON sneaks in sometimes. I’m passionate about security, stability, and writing clean, readable code – always sticking to PEP8 standards.  

## Support Me  
If you’d like to support my main project (**Imperium**) and help me achieve one of my dreams – building a large, active Discord community – feel free to join my server: [Imperium Discord](https://discord.gg/7DFXSvcETu).
